- Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?  
No. HTML elements are defined by a starting tag, may contain some content and a closing tag.For example,
<h1>Heading 1</h1> is a HTML element but just <h1> is a starting tag and </h1> is a closing tag.

- What are void elements in HTML?  
HTML elements which do not have closing tags or do not need to be closed are Void elements. 
For Example <br />, <img />, <hr />, etc.

- What is the difference between the ‘id’ attribute and the ‘class’ attribute of HTML elements?  
Multiple elements in HTML can have the same class value, whereas a value of id attribute of 
one element cannot be associated with another HTML element.
