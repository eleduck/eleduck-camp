- What are the conditional directives?
```
VueJS provides a set of directives to show or hide elements based on conditions. 
The available directives are: v-if, v-else, v-else-if and v-show
```
- What is the purpose of v-for directive?
```
The built-in v-for directive allows us to loop through items in an array or object. 
You can iterate on each element in the array or object.
```
- How do you implement two-way binding?
```
We can use the v-model directive to create two-way data bindings on form input, 
textarea, and select elements.
```
- What are props?
```
Props are custom attributes you can register on a component. When a value is passed to
a prop attribute, it becomes a property on that component instance. You can pass those 
list of values as props option and use them as similar to data variables in template.
```
