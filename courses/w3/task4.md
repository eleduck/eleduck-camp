  `v-if`, `v-else-if`, `v-else`.
  
- What is the purpose of v-for directive?
  The built-in v-for directive allows us to loop through items in an array or object. You can iterate on each element in the array or object.

- How do you implement two-way binding?
  Yes, we can use the v-model directive to create two-way data bindings on form input, textarea, and select elements.

- What are props?
  Props are custom attributes you can register on a component. When a value is passed to a prop attribute, it becomes a property on that component instance. You can pass those list of values as props option and use them as similar to data variables in template.
