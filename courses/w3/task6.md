# Writing - Daily Scrum

- What did you do yesterday?
    - Go Through the Nuxt docs, learn about SSR (Server side Rendering) knowledge.
    - Created a "Hello world" Nuxt project locally, using Vuetify as the UI framework.
    - Try asyncData with axios in the "Hello world" project
- What will you do today?
Try to deploy the project to Netlify.
- Is there anything blocking you?
Not quite familiar with the detailed frontend stuff, e.g. async/await, axios. Need a little time to Google it.
