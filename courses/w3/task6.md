# Writing - Daily Scrum

- What did you do yesterday?
```
Debug equipment parameters
```
- What will you do today?
```
Optimize the equipment test process yesterday and make notes at the same time
```
- Is there anything blocking you?
```
Multi-person cooperation, sometimes in order to wait for others to modify the code, it is time-consuming
```
