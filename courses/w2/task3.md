## Teamwork

- Talk about a time when you had to work closely with someone whose personality was very different from yours.
- Give me an example of a time you faced a conflict while working in a team. How did you handle that?  
Once, a colleague in the customer service department, let's call him Bob. Bob contacted me and said that there was an emergency that needed our department's help. After I learned the situation, I immediately contacted a colleague who could handle the problem. While waiting for feedback, Bob came again and angrily asked when the problem would be solved. I controlled the emotion of wanting to fight with him and said, I understand that you want to solve the customer's problem quickly. I have contacted my colleague. He also knows that this is an emergency. I believe he will deal with it as quickly as possible. Let's not disturb him, can you wait for his feedback? Bob also realized that emotions did not help solve the problem, and planned to go back and wait for the news. One minute later, my colleague reported that the problem was solved. Later Bob also expressed his gratitude for our quick response.
- Describe a time when you struggled to build a relationship with someone important. How did you eventually overcome that?
- We all make mistakes we wish we could take back. Tell me about a time you wish you’d handled a situation differently with a colleague.
- Tell me about a time you needed to get information from someone who wasn’t very responsive. What did you do?  
Once a colleague did not reply to my message, the next day I sent another message to remind him and make a phone call.
- Give an example of how you work in a team.
- What do you do if you disagree with someone in your work?  
I will explain to him why I have different ideas, and I want to hear why he chose another option. This kind of situation is usually in the sprint planning meeting, when other colleagues will be there, and we also listen to the opinions of other colleagues.

## Communication

- Give me an example of a time when you were able to successfully convince someone doing things in your way at work.

- Tell me about a time when you had to rely on written communication to get your ideas across to your team.
- Give me an example of a time when you had to explain something fairly complex to a frustrated client. How did you handle this delicate situation?
- Tell me about a successful presentation you gave and why you think it was a hit.
