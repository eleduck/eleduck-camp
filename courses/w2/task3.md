## Teamwork

- Talk about a time when you had to work closely with someone whose personality was very different from yours.
  Once cto arranged my colleague and I to execute a new project, I will arrange the overall and my colleague will participate in the execution.
  My colleague code is more abstract, but I like simple and effective.
  But it is not required to write the same style
  so at the code and business level，Separate tasks as much as possible to perform individually
- Give me an example of a time you faced a conflict while working in a team. How did you handle that?
  Tell him why I did it and the advantages, and then let the right person choose
- Describe a time when you struggled to build a relationship with someone important. How did you eventually overcome that?
  I was working as a new supervisor with a colleague who had been working for a longer time.
  There was some friction, and I was afraid to face it directly
  Frankly speaking, I didn't deal with it well, I avoided it and gave the problem to others (I would clarify my authority and execute it well.)
  If I were to face it again, I would try to build the trust of each other and work together to solve the problem.
  Instead of giving up and letting someone else deal with it
- We all make mistakes we wish we could take back. Tell me about a time you wish you’d handled a situation differently with a colleague.

  Once answered a colleague's question by saying that it was simple
  led my colleague to think I was rather conceited.
  Now I will be more friendly and pay attention to the details of the explanation

- Tell me about a time you needed to get information from someone who wasn’t very responsive. What did you do?

At one point, there was a project that relied heavily on the back-end Api, but the back-end Api was changed and changed, and delayed and delayed.
I had to keep pushing the back-end programmer.
At the same time, I informed the product manager and project manager in the daily meeting.
and synchronize the information with them

- Give an example of how you work in a team.
  The company system is relatively good, and my work is performed in a step-by-step manner
  For example, getting the requirements, finding the problems with the requirements, executing the requirements
- What do you do if you disagree with someone in your work?
  At one point there was a page with components that I thought should be more abstract and generic, and another colleague thought the business was unstable and frequently modified, and should be relatively more independent.
  Then I told him what I thought was the merit of this, and finally used the other's solution for the sake of team unity

## Communication

- Give me an example of a time when you were able to successfully convince someone doing things in your way at work.
- Describe a time when you were the resident technical expert. What did you do to make sure everyone was able to understand you?
- Tell me about a time when you had to rely on written communication to get your ideas across to your team.
