## Teamwork

- Talk about a time when you had to work closely with someone whose personality was very different from yours.

There was a time that I need to work with my co-workers closely. He was a short-tempered person, and it was not easy
to accomplish the project with him.

- Give me an example of a time you faced a conflict while working in a team. How did you handle that?

I had a conflict with the product manager about the double dialogs, he wants to open a new dialog in the current dialog. 
I think it is unnecessary to use a dialog because the second dialog only shows one sentence. It is more appropriate to use
a popover, and I made two examples to persuade him. Finally, he took my advice.

I often use examples to convince others, list some possible scenarios and discuss which one is better.

- Describe a time when you were the resident technical expert. What did you do to make sure everyone was able to understand you?

I start by understanding the skill orientation of the participants and try to describe the technical solution as easy to understand.

- Tell me about a time when you had to rely on written communication to get your ideas across to your team.

When I have to rely on written communication, I will take very careful with the sentences, try to express my idea clearly and exactly.
