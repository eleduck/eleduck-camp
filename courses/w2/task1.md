Dear xxx:
	I have found your recruitment information from Eleduck.com. I`m writing to apply front-end developer at your company. I believe my four years of front-end development
experience makes me an excellent candidate for the position.
	I have structured an e-commerce platform in which I do the front-end development independently. This project made me proficient in Vue.js/Vue-router/Vuex/Element UI.
	In my secondary work experience at Yitu Tech which is an artificial intelligence company, I was responsible for developing and iterating the product named Face Platform.
Face Platform used React and some related skills such as Redux/Ant Design/Redux-saga/Hooks on the front-end development.
	I believe my experience makes me more suitable for this job. I`m a professional skilled front-end developer who can resolve efficiently in development. And I am a good
team worker with a positive attitude.
	I can do a great job in this position. And the remote opportunity offered by this position is exactly what I`m looking for. I can improve the team`s efficiency, enrich the
front-end development docs, bring joy to the team.
	Thank you for you time
