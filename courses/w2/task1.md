Dear xxx:
	I have found your recruitment information from Eleduck.com. I'm writing to apply the front-end developer position
at your company. I believe my four years of front-end development experience make me a great candidate for the job.
	I have structured an e-commerce platform in which I do the front-end development independently. This project made me
proficient in Vue.js/Vue-router/Vuex/Element UI.
	In my secondary work experience at Yitu Tech which is an artificial intelligence company, I was responsible for 
developing and iterating the product named Face Platform.Face Platform used React and some related skills such as Redux/Ant
Design/Redux-saga/Hooks on the front-end development.
	I believe my experience makes me very suitable for this job. I'm a professional skilled front-end developer who can
resolve problems efficiently in development. And I am a goodteam player with a positive attitude.
	I can do a great job in this position. And the remote opportunity offered by this position is exactly what I'm 
looking for. I can improve the efficiency of the team, enrich the front-end development docs, bring joy to the team.
	Thank you for you time.
