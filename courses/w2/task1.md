  - Do they like you （Interest）
    yes,Most people like me , they will say I am more detail-oriented and friendly
    Some might not like me since I usually insist on my points in technical discussion.
    But I will gain their respect, because I will tell the other party the advantages of my solutions.
    If the other person insists on doing it his way, I will also respect that, rather than obstructing the other person's approach.
    Things need to move forward, and although it's not the best way to do it, it's better than arguing.
