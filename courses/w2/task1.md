Dear leader

Recently, I saw that your company is recruiting back-end development on the Internet. I have been doing back-end development over the years, and I have seen a lot in common.
Although I am usually busy at work, I will also think about how to improve working methods and methods in my spare time. When I have no ideas, my colleagues around you can always help you. This is the case at work, and everyone will also take time to meet after work. Do some activities. In order to improve the working method, I developed a set of project joint debugging system in my spare time, using springmvc+tomcat+mysql, the front end and back end are designed by myself. Although the interface is not very beautiful, the functions are very rich, which effectively improves everyone's Work efficiency.
Although I don’t speak much, I am also happy to share, such as gadgets, food, recent movies, and so on. I get along very well with everyone. Everyone will ask me if they have problems, and sometimes they will find colleagues who can handle them if they can’t solve them by themselves.
Looking forward to meeting with you and discussing in more detail.

Sincerely.
