I found your hiring information from eleduck.com. You are looking for a backend engineer experienced with Java, Spring, and MySQL, that's me. I'm seeking a more challenging job opportunity with more users and more complex services.
I've been a full-time web backend developer for more than three years. I'm well equipped with the skills you need including Java, Spring, MySQL, Redis, Kafka, Git, etc. I participated in developing several projects and was the main force of them, solved many tricky problems, and optimized some projects. So I believe I am qualified for the job.
Deeply involved in communications with project managers, I could determine the actual target they wanted to achieve. In the team, we shall review each other's code to avoid potential bugs and improve our coding abilities.
I'm like playing video games, especially multiplayer corporation games, such as Borderland, Dying Light, Stellaris. It's exciting to have fun and anticipate enemies with friends in a different world.
