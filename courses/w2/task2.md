# Writing - Ability to Adapt

- Tell me about a time you were under a lot of pressure. What was going on, and how did you get through it?  
Once, a back-end service frequently reported errors during the morning and evening peak hours. The customer service department also reported that many customers complained that the service was unavailable. The Boss also paid close attention to this problem and hoped that the platform could provide more stable services to customers. We were under pressure at that time. Because every time this service report OOM and is restarted, there will be customer data loss. Our preliminary judgment is the problem is caused by the insufficient processing capacity of some downstream services. The temporary solution is to increase resources to cache peak data to ensure the user data will not be lost. Then we had time to investigate the specific problem. Later we found the downstream bottleneck service and made corresponding adjustments to the platform architecture, add cache in front of this service, and replaced the downstream service with a time-series database.
- Describe a time when your team or company was undergoing some change. How did that impact you, and how did you adapt?  
There has been a change. Due to the company's business problems, our team was reduced in size, and the guys in charge of the CI/CD tools left. The leader asked me to take over part of the work. I didn't know much about shell script, ansible, and GoCD..., but after a period of study, I have been able to help the teammates deal with some deployment script issues.
- Tell me about the first job youâ€™ve ever had. What did you do to learn the ropes?  
When I was in my first job, I didn't know much about technology detail and business logic. On the one hand, the main way of learning was to ask the seniors for advice, and the other was to read the source code and read related technical books. In some complicated places, debugging might be possible. Take a look and see how that piece of code works.
- Give me an example of a time when you had to think on your feet in order to delicately extricate yourself from a difficult or awkward situation.
- Tell me about a time you failed. How did you deal with the situation?
