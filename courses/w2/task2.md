# Writing - Ability to Adapt

- Tell me about a time you were under a lot of pressure. What was going on, and how did you get through it?
  I feel the most pressure year is 2018 years. There is a very tight task, many people think it is impossible, including me, but it must also be done. I overcome the pressure and analyze the needs carefully, devised a solution to the problem, and split the task. Our team through hard work, finally completed this task.

- Describe a time when your team or company was undergoing some change. How did that impact you, and how did you adapt?
  If the environment can't be changed, change yourself. Recognize the purpose and meaning of one's existence and continue to complete one's work.

- Tell me about the first job youâ€™ve ever had. What did you do to learn the ropes?
  My first job was in Shanghai, I hadn't graduated yet. My boss I met when I was in school. We had known each other for a long time before I confirmed this job. So while maintaining your value, your network is very important, it will bring you many opportunities.

- Give me an example of a time when you had to think on your feet in order to delicately extricate yourself from a difficult or awkward situation.
  There was a debugging problem, I always thought it was someone else's problem, but in the end, I find it was my problem, so awkward. Then I took the initiative to admit my mistakes, apologize to others at the same time.

- Tell me about a time you failed. How did you deal with the situation?
  Once, I evaluated the wrong time for a task, causing the work to not be completed on time. I analyze the cause immediately, find the problem, and make a detailed report, complete the remaining work as soon as possible.
