# Writing - Ability to Adapt

- Tell me about a time you were under a lot of pressure. What was going on, and how did you get through it?
  In 2018, I felt a lot of pressure as there was a very emergency and challenging task, many people think it is impossible, including me, but it must be done. I overcome the pressure and analyze the needs carefully, devised a solution to the problem, and split the task. Our team finally completed this task through hard work.

- Describe a time when your team or company was undergoing some change. How did that impact you, and how did you adapt?
  If the environment can't be changed, change yourself. Recognize the purpose and meaning of one's existence and continue to complete one's work.

- Tell me about the first job youâ€™ve ever had. What did you do to learn the ropes?
  My first job was in Shanghai, I hadn't graduated yet. I met my boss when I was in school. We had known each other for a long time before I confirmed this job. I taught myself web development related technologies in school, such as PHP, HTML5, CSS, etc, and use them more deeply at work. I learned that while maintaining your value, your network is very important, it will bring you many opportunities.

- Give me an example of a time when you had to think on your feet in order to delicately extricate yourself from a difficult or awkward situation.
  There was a bug, I always thought it was someone else's problem, but in the end, I found it was my problem, so awkward. Then I took the initiative to admit my mistakes, apologized to others at the same time.

- Tell me about a time you failed. How did you deal with the situation?
  Once, I evaluated the wrong time for a project, I realized the problem until there were only 3 days before the deadline. I re-evaluated the project, report the issue and provide a new solution to my team. We completed the project on time. Since then, I have always double-checked my work.
