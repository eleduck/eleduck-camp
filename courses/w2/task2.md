  When I first joined my present company, I was responsible for a difficult task that reconstructed The Customer Marketing 
Management System in 40 days. This task gives me a lot of pressure because I know nothing about this system. Nevertheless, 
we succeeded to deployed the system on time. Under the pressure, I made a clear plan: First I needed to be familiar with 
the original system, then I develop modules according to their importance.

  A few months ago, my department has accomplished the reformation of the salary system, all of the stuff needs to be regraded.
Fortunately, I had a happy ending: I got a little promotion, and so did my salary.

My first job is responsible for building an e-commerce platform from scratch. Before that, I only worked on a few small projects.
It was not easy at the beginning, I had encountered many problems, I always worked overtime these days. As time goes by my work 
has been much smoother as my abilities have improved.

  I once had a problem with cascader from Element UI, the cascader`s options are async data from the backend service. When 
I need to show the option that has already been selected, because the cascader was not triggered to fetch async data, 
it has no alternative option items, and you can not show the selected data from the service. I spent a lot of time fixing it,
but I failed. In the end, I put a "mask" that covered the cascader, and show the selected data on it.
