# Writing - Ability to Adapt

- Tell me about a time you were under a lot of pressure. What was going on, and how did you get through it?
- Describe a time when your team or company was undergoing some change. How did that impact you, and how did you adapt?
- Tell me about the first job youâ€™ve ever had. What did you do to learn the ropes?
- Give me an example of a time when you had to think on your feet in order to delicately extricate yourself from a difficult or awkward situation.
- Tell me about a time you failed. How did you deal with the situation?

There were lots of times I had to catch up with the deadline. Mostly, the work was finished in time, but sometimes, it was delayed for some reason. The most important reason is that the process was miss estimated. The whole project wasn't decomposed properly, and the team was over-optimistic. Another critical reason is the target was misunderstood, the whole team went down the wrong path.
After experiencing those unsuccessful circumstances, I prefer to decompose the task into very small pieces, so the time spent on each piece shall be calculated more precisely. And I would check the current status with the project manager or team leader frequently to ensure I didn't do something wrong or something unnecessary.
I have taken lots of coding contests, which did put me under a pressure environment. Firstly, I checked the problem description many times to ensure I got the point. Secondly, I compared each problem to decide their priorities. It's of no use to be nervous if I was stuck. If I can't solve the problem, I would pass it or try another method.
Three years ago, I got my first job as a backend developer, but I joined an Android team to support their log collection and alarm system. With the patient guidance of the team leader, I learned the way to develop a service using many different tools. I read the document to dive deeper into the technologies.
When the project was completed, I was transferred to another team. This time I adapted to the new team by myself. I read the code, asked for teammates, involved in the developing lifecycle, which made me fit into the new team.
I used to publish some bug code in the online environment. Some accounts reported that they can't trade. So I rolled the code immediately. After that, I checked the code and figured out why the bug occurred. I had to modify the code, find a way to fix the corrupt data, and I did it. I learned a lot from those failures.****
