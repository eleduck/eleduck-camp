# Writing - Time Management

- Tell me about a time you had to be very strategic in order to meet all your top priorities.
  That's a mall system that I did before. As the technical director, I promote the operation of the entire project. After a period of development, the mall's flow continues to grow. I realize that the security of funds is an important hidden danger in our future. So I organized and promoted the development of the fund monitoring system. Facts have proved that this system has resisted many illegal attacks for us.

- Describe a long-term project that you managed. How did you keep everything moving along in a timely manner?
  1. Develop a long-term work plan for the project;
  2. Clarify the mission objectives at this stage;
  3. Split tasks according to job division;
  4. Record all tasks on the agile development panel;
  5. Synchronize the progress of all tasks in the morning meeting;
  6. Find hidden dangers in time-based on feedback and adjust the plan in time;
  7. Pay attention to the work status of the team, promptly motivate and improve;

- Sometimes itâ€™s just not possible to get everything on your to-do list done. Tell me about a time your responsibilities got a little overwhelming. What did you do?
  1. Re-evaluate the priority of all tasks;
  2. Conquer one by one from easy to difficult;
  3. As much as possible to complete the scheduled work on the same day;
  4. If some work cannot be done on the same day, I will analyze whether the unfinished work affects others, and if so, I will explain to him in advance to obtain his understanding;

- Tell me about a time you set a goal for yourself. How did you go about ensuring that you would meet your objective?
  1. Analyze the important and difficult points of the goal
  2. Split the goal into multiple small goals;
  3. Develop working nodes for small goals;
  4. Advance the work as planned;

- Give me an example of a time you managed numerous responsibilities. How did you handle that?
  Once I was responsible for the overall development of 3 projects at the same time. I will list the tasks I do every day in a table. Follow the development progress of all projects through the agile development panel. Maintain communication with all team members. Find and solve problems in time.

- Why do you choose remote work? How do you cooperative with teammates in different time zones?
  Remote work makes work more pure. Let our time focus more on the goal itself. While we generate value through work, we can also enjoy life better. While cooperative with teammates in different time zones, I will do my work independently as much as possible. If I encounter some necessary problems, I will list the problems encountered in a table and describe them in detail, send them to colleagues by mail or slack, and then go to finish other work. When I get a reply, I will follow up as soon as possible, and if possible, we will communicate in real-time.
