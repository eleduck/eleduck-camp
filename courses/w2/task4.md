# Writing - Time Management

- Tell me about a time you had to be very strategic in order to meet all your top priorities.
- Describe a long-term project that you managed. How did you keep everything moving along in a timely manner? 
``` 
For long-term projects, we generally split the tasks first, then prioritize them according to their dependencies and importance, and then put the task in each sprint to complete in batches. Once we wanted to upgrade the version of a database, we discussed it at a planning meeting and found that there are many unknown factors in this task, such as the difference between the two versions of the database, the compatibility of data files, and which services depend on this database. In the first week, we split these survey questions into several stories. We investigated separately and summarized the results in the next sprint planning meeting, After analysis, we determined the migration plan and the following tasks. Because the version span is relatively large, there are compatibility issues, considering the business dependence, we decided not to upgrade on the original database, but to build a new database and gradually migrate the business. We split several subtasks and put them into backlog:
    - create a new database
    - change the writing service to write the old database and new database at the same time
    - migrate read-only service gradually
    - switch the writing service to the new database after two week
    - release the old database

The teammate who takes these tasks will update the latest status and problems encountered in the stand-up meeting. At the planning meeting, we will discuss the status of the previous week and the tasks planned to be completed next week. Finally, it took 5 sprints to complete the database migration.

- Sometimes itâ€™s just not possible to get everything on your to-do list done. Tell me about a time your responsibilities got a little overwhelming. What did you do?
- Tell me about a time you set a goal for yourself. How did you go about ensuring that you would meet your objective?  
I want to read the book *Soft Skills: The software developer's life manual* in my spare time, but I'm not sure how long I can finish it. In the first week, I started to try to read it in my spare time. By the end of the week, I could read about 20%, and then I set a goal to finish reading this book in 5 weeks, about 3% per day, and about 20% per week, After I have a goal, I won't think about playing LOL in my free time, In the end, I finished reading this book in about 4 weeks.
- Give me an example of a time you managed numerous responsibilities. How did you handle that?
- Why do you choose remote work? How do you cooperative with teammates in different time zones?  
Remote work can save commuting time, better balance work and life, and you can choose work regardless of region. As for cooperating with colleagues, if it is not urgent, we can use slack and leave a message, or send an email, and schedule an online meeting for complicated issues, and for urgent issues, we can make a phone call.
