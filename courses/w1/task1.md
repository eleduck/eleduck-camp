This is Jiamin Liu. I am based in Toronto and studying the graduate program at OCAD university. Before arrived the Toronto, I have worked as a User experience designer for 4 years. Gym is my favourite hobbies, hence I usually exercise to keep full of spirit and abundant strength. My undergraduate major is industrual design, and my master program is digital mediaï¼Œwhich is about exploring combination of Art, Design, Technology. In my spare time, I am used to staying with my cat and relax my spirit. When it comes to long term plans, I would like to creat my own Digital Transformation Design Consulting Company. But now, I hope to focus on the short term goal that finish very student program and find the high-paying full-time work. The last but the most important, I hope I can spend every day happily.
