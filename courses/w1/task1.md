# Self-introduction

My name is Yance, a frontend engineer who has five years of experience. 
I live in Shanghai now, which is one of the biggest cities in China. I like playing TFT, which is a strategy game both on
PC/Mobile, and science fiction movies. Like many peers, I love electronic music very much, always listen 
to it when taking the subway.

I graduated from Hunan Engineering College in Jun 2016, got a bachelor of engineering degree. 

My short-term plan is to take every lesson at Eleduck English Camp, to improve reading & writing, and to finish and submit
each task on time. And to Remember as many as possible new words that relate to my profession.

The long-term plan is to find a full-time remote job or be a freelancer. Then I can go back to my hometown where is closer
to my family and live in my own house. Take it a step further, I want to immigrate to Canada with my whole family.

Which is important in my life? This is a simple question for me right now: I want a work-life balance. That is why I started
studying English, only working remotely can help me achieve it in China, and good English takes a hand.
