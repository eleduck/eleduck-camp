My name is Ma Liangkai, a developer living in Beijing. I've been dedicated to coding for about ten years since I was in high school, because its’ interesting and challenging, and it continuously brought me to a new world, from algorithm to the distributed system, from solo coding to crossing group corporation. I have never doubted that coding shall be my lifelong work and interest.
I was born in Laizhou, Shandong Province, which is a quite small town within about thirty minutes of driving around the whole urban. It’s really beautiful, and the air is fresh, the sky is blue, the street is clean, the traffic is not heavy, which is the exact opposite of Beijing. I have lived in the city for about eighteen years until I went to Jilin University located in Changchun, Jilin Province.
Playing computer games is the most important amusement for me. Different from most people, I love the stand-alone game, for the better image quality, the ups and downs of the impressive story, the abundant game types. I would get bored if I play LOL or Honor of Kings for several days, with the same map, same pattern, and same hero. I’ve played about thirty computer games when I was in college, that was too much crazy, resulting in I couldn’t catch up on the lesson, that’s so bad.
While I was in senior, I began to chase a girl, who eventually became my fiancée and will be my wife soon. She’s the smartest and charming girl I’ve ever met, I enjoy all the time spent with her, even though we had fights and divergence in some time, she’s the major meaning of my life. That’s why I hate 996 and look forward to a more balanced work and life.
To achieve a better life, I’m planning to migrate to Canada in recent years, so improving my English skill gradually is critical for me. Ideally, I could be hired by a famous foreign company recently, years or later, I shall get an offer from a Canadian company with a work visa.
Jessie, I heard that you have had a baby in Canada at the conference last night, I’m quite curious about your experience such as hospital, policy, kindergarten, etc., because I’m considering having a baby in China or Canada, and I didn’t get a conclusion yet. Maybe we could have a one-to-one chat or something else, it depends on you.
Thanks for your review, have a nice day.
