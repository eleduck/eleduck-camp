# Writing - Talk about your work

- Talk about your current working situation.  
I am working in an Agile team, we have almost all the skills necessary to deliver a full-stack solution.
- How many members are in your team?  
There are 9 people in our team.
- Talk about your teammates.  
Our team is cross-functional, we have a few backend and front-end developers, one designer, one DBA and one mobile developer. Our team even has an embedded developer who also has the role of a backend developer.

- What are your roles and responsibilities?
    - I am mainly working on the backend development. Develop and maintain the protocol-parse service, process or forward or store data according to various business scenarios.
    - I am also responsible for the data pushing service, push data to third-party partners.
    - I am taking scrum master role in the team as well.

- What are your best skills?  
High concurrency service optimization. For example, before optimization, we had a service deployed with 10 nodes, but occasionally OOM is reported, after optimization, the service runs more smoothly, and then we release 6 nodes.
- What techniques/languages do you want to work with in the future?  
In the future, I want to work with Java, Golang with microservice architecture, and I am also interested in Rust and Service Mesh.
- Talk about your favorite editor  
My favorite editor is Intellij.
- Talk about your favorite open source project.  
My favorite open source project is Asahi Linux. It is a project with the goal of porting Linux to Apple Silicon Macs. The Apple Silicon is an entirely undocumented platform, the community need to make reverse engineering the Apple GPU architecture and develop an open-source driver for it. It is so cool, I like it.
- Tell me about a typical day at work.  
After I arrive at the office in the morning, I usually take a look at the monitoring of the production environment first, then update the status of my tasks on the Kanban, and prepare a little bit for the stand-up meeting, after the 15-minutes meeting, I will focus on my development tasks, and occasionally needed to deal with the alarm of the production environment and investigate the problems.
- How do you work with your teammates?
    - On the first day of each sprint, our team will hold a sprint planning meeting. The team will decompose tasks from high-priority tasks and put them into the sprint backlog. The team will discuss the design of each requirement at this meeting.
    - Every morning we will have a stand-up meeting where the team syncs their status, and everyone has to answer three questions, What did you do yesterday? What will you do today? Is there anything blocking you?
- How do you work with your cross-functional teams?
In the sprint plan meeting, the team will discuss the requirements together. Professionals in different fields will give opinions from a professional perspective. If problems are encountered during the development process, we will communicate in the daily meeting, or use pair programming to solve the problem.
