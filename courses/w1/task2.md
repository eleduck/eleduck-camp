# Writing - Talk about your work

- Talk about your current working situation.
  Just like other front-end engineers, I review product requirements, give feedback, split into different todo's, anticipate the deadline of this todo, fix the bugs of the previous todo's
- How many members are in your team?
  I only know the technical staff, almost 30 people or so, other parts of the staff rarely communicate with each other
- Talk about your teammates.
  All are very good team members, some explain to you the details of the protocol, and the process of handling data, and some talk to you about the pace of work, the need to rest, and others share with you various details of life
- What are your roles and responsibilities?
  Because I am more familiar with code, I occasionally help new programmers, such as explaining code and sorting out more complex requirements.
  Most of the time, I am still busy with developing new todo.
- What are your best skills?
  Efficiently complete front-end problems with a certain technical depth and complexity under certain constraints
  Communicate efficiently with product, qa, design, back-end, and work out solutions.
- What techniques/languages do you want to work with in the future?

  1. erlang
     The cpu will have more and more cores.
     People will become more and more dependent on the Internet.
     The further impact of decentralization on society
     And maximizing the use of cpu multi-core performance, how to maximize the availability, distributed performance
  2. rust
     The most up-to-date, ,the language closest to the front end, firefox is made with rust, the new deno is also based on rust

  3. The next job requires me to use the language.
     In a complex society there will be complex needs, and different needs will have different language features to deal with. As a pragmatist, I will not limit myself to a fixed language.

- Talk about your favorite editor
  1. vscode Used every day
  2. spacemacs,vim+emacs ,But there are not enough plug-ins, such as support for the very small details of typescript css
- Talk about your favorite open source project.

  1. react, gave me the work, ui how to use functions, data to solve, write predictable, abstract UI code
  2. lodash, which gave me the tools to solve various data problems
  3. gun/couchdb/cassandra , thinking about what the next generation database should be like

- Tell me about a typical day at work.
  Like I answered in the first question, that is, the difference between this and the first question is?
- How do you work with your teammates?
  Other front-end, discuss where mutual needs. Divide clearly
  Front end LEADER, review her code
- How do you work with your cross-functional teams?
  Back-end: ask him what the new interface will look like and get the data model as early as possible. Avoid docking conflicts, wait for the other side api document out, the project manager is already pushing you to hurry up and finish it.
  ui: check the design conflicts as early as possible, such as certain implementation costs are large, or do not meet the specifications defined by ui itself, such as certain strange-looking
  Check early to see what are similar between designs to avoid doing duplicate work.
  product: tell him what other conditions have not been taken into account, and pull up the back end to ask for clarification of the technical correctness of this logic
  Other departments: rarely deal with
