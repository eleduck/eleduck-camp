# Talk about your work

I`m working in a lease finance company as a front-end engineer. The company is located in Pudong New Distinction, it takes one hour and fifteen minutes to take a subway from the house I rented to the company.
Usually, I leave to work at 7 am and get back home at 9 pm.

There are about 5 front-end engineers, 8 back-end engineers, 3 production managers, and 2 user interface designers in my team. Most of my teammates are older than me, they are very nice at work.

As a front-end engineer, I finished daily development tasks,  and I helped others solve their problems in front-end development sometimes. I also turn to others for advice when I have problems.

I`m good at turn original pictures into web pages. Front-end development is my favorite until now, I like the feeling of what you see is what you get.
In the future, I will still do front-end development.

VS Code is the best editor for a front-end developer in my opinion. 

There is a daily scrum meeting when I started work, it will take twenty minutes or more. Then we get back to the respective table station and finish the tasks which are assigned in the meeting. Sometimes there are some meetings about production or API in the afternoon.
