As a backend developer, I've been working in the company for about one year and a half. An ordinary routine of my daily life is that I will go to work at ten o'clock, and I'll be at the company before half-past ten. About eight-thirty pm, I will leave the company and will be home at nine pm. I used to believe the long working time is inevitable, but after knowing the remote work and some examples of living in developed countries, I decided to have a new life, despite there are difficulties and troubles.
I'm responsible for a trading system individually, which sounds like I'm playing a significant role in the company, but the truth is that the system is so simple that one developer is enough to handle all the mess. I have no team, and the job is boring, that's one reason why I'm looking forward to a new job.
Even though, I have to send a merge request to my leader and wait for his review. More often, he forgot to review my code, I have to push him time after time. But he's a nice person, he is kind all the time, even if the server crashed. The whole group I belong to has eleven people including myself. Usually, we have lunch together several times a week. Everyone is easy to get on with, but I still feel kind of lonely.
Communication with colleagues in the team or out of the team is not a problem for me. With well-written docs and immediate talk, almost everything will be done efficiently and accurately. And a weekly meeting is enough for me to report my work process and plan for the next week.
Intellij IDEA is the best developing tool I've ever used. It contains almost all the things I need to get my work done. Java and MySQL is the core technique of my skill list. I'd like to learn more about AWS, Kubernetes in the future, which are the most popular infrastructure of most foreign tech companies, and I think SaaS and containers are the trends. 
At the coding level, I prefer readable code rather than so-called 'efficient' code, because readable code could be efficient, but 'efficient' code is hard to be readable. I'm good at refactoring legacy code, improving code quality steadily, and the experience left me with a deeper understanding of design patterns.
Being an expert in distributed systems is my long-term goal. To achieve the goal, I've learned some lessons about system design. It's hard to design a system myself and the studying curve is quite steep. As time goes by, I believe I will achieve the gold eventually.
