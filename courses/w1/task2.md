I quit my full tiime product design job in August this year, so I am looking for part time job or internship opportunities. In the last job, my team includes front-end engineers, back-end engineers, hardware engineers, testers, product managers, product designers, etc. I love that team, because everyone is helpful and friendly. For example, engineers always help me to think how to solve the problems and developer function by using my design solution, when I meet the problems. As a product designer, my role is more like a solver of business problems, the most important part of my job is analysing the requirements and using design to connect digital products and users. What i am good at is designing product's interactive function after analysing the market and users. In the future, I would like to work with JavaScript, because I plan to develop in the front-end field. When it comes to the favourite editor, I think I don't prefer any kind of editor, because I think they are just the tool, which should be used to solve problems. In addition, I also don't prefer any open source project, because I think any open source have own valuation.
A typical day at work strats from a Daily Scrum. In this Daily Scrum, Project manager host the full sprint, and team player need to update ther task, includes different statuses of delivery. After everyone updated, Project manager will summarize team work and unified goals. Then, we start to put into the work of the day.
I used to conform every goal before we start to co-work, because clear common goal helps improve work efficiency. When I need to face to cross-functional teams, I will use the same process and confirm the same goal with stakeholders.
