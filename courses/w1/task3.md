I used to work for Guazi.com since my graduation as a backend developer. The first project I took over is a log collection system. It keeps collecting logs from the mobile phones and sends them to Kafka, after that the logs will be sent to Hive where the logs are stored and queried. The system facilities the whole Mobile team to figure out bugs, and the responsibility of why the bug appeared can be distinguished well between the Mobile team and backend Team. As a sink of Kafka, Flink is used for aggregating each log to indicate whether the whole system is healthy. The alarm shall be sent to us if there is something bad happened immediately.
The project above is my favorite, in that it's my first project, I put lots of time and effort into it. Secondly, many technologies are used in the project, which I spent lots of time digging into, and those experiences led me to a better comprehension of the nowadays distributed system. In the meanwhile, many teammates became my friends, and we enjoyed our time while having lunch and hanging out, and my mentor taught me a lot about how to work, how to communicate, how to deal with people correctly. He was like a big brother to me, and I respected him very much. It's a precious experience for me.
Later, I was involved in a new team, developed an exam system. The system is designed for newbie car inspector to improve their efficiency and accuracy. The implement of the exam system is straightforward, it randomly selects some online cases, and shows them to the car inspector. After submitting his answers, the car inspector will see the difference from the correct answers.
My tech stack consists of Java, MySQL, Kafka, Redis, and some assistance techs such as Git, UML, Markdown. I believe that all the techs can be mastered with sufficient practice and project experience, the key is to join a team using the tech. Going to a higher level, there are the pros and cons of certain tech and the philosophy behind it. It's the most valuable part worth digging deeper and deeper, other than the subtle details of a specific tech.
