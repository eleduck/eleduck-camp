Product Designer, Grab
Beijing, China & Singapore  02/2020 - Present 
•Create new product design system for Grab Wheels software and hardware using css, html language while collaborating with development team
•Lead field survey and consumer research to observe and analyze behavioral characteristics of Southeast Asia stakeholders including drivers, passengers, operators, etc
•Implement inclusive design to increase the satisfaction of our users’ daily commute experience
•Analyze and visualize online behavioral and B2C products’ data by using digital software to help operators improve their operational efficiencies

My favourite project is the recent master program, Body As Controller, which is based on the P5js. The program simulates cat behavior with a human body, such as catching, obtaining real objects through coquetry, and doing night activities. Players can interact with the computer through their bodies and get visual and auditory feedback. 

In the new master program, I start to study technical language and expore my own tech stack: JavaScript, CSS, HTML5. I completed this project independently. When I meet some problems, such as bug, I ask my mentor or google it. My responsibilities are trying my best to finish and developer it.
