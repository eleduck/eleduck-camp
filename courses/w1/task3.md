# Writing - Describe your previous projects

- Talk about your former companies and projects
  Last job, I wrote the code from scratch from the server-side rendering framework to support the rapid response of different customer sites
  Previous job, I implemented a business across web management system (create activities), react native (participate in activities) + mobile responsive pages ((show activity information), activity statistics system canvas + svg (show statistics)
- Which is your favorite project and why?
  My own blog (actually intended to be designed as a decentralized, low-code system)
  It belongs to me, all, from the backend, to the database, to the logic, to the design.
  It has prompted me to think about the future of
  How about a decentralized data structure, which involves the design of permissions in a distributed situation. Data synchronization design. Data storage, index design. Trusted design of data
  How to make pages, functions can be plug-in combination, directly distributed
  Point immediately, use immediately.
  From now on. It demonstrates my skills.
  It is a cross-end comprehensive product
  From desktop to web, to mobile, to server. I even plan to make a cli for this project
  It forces me to the principle of minimal dependency.
  If you were to maintain a project like this alone, you would want it to be as simple as possible, in every sense of the word

- What tech stack have you used before?
  vue Full Family Bucket
  drupal Family Bucket
- What were your roles and responsibilities?

  It's always been the front end. There is no difference.
  Previously, consider the problem less complex. Just do the line
  Now more forethought.
  For example, I will prepare to support unexpected situations in advance
  And for urgent cases, I will plan ahead if I need additional support from others if the issues take long time to complete.
  And I will take care of more details, and take new colleagues into consideration, since they usually break things.
