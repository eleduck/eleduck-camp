# Writing - Describe your previous projects

- Talk about your former companies and projects
My former company is an IT service company, and the project was mainly to develop customized information management systems for enterprises. My department is mainly for European and American customers.
- Which is your favorite project and why?
My favorite project is an Android App cracking project. A customer wants to know whether the App developed by a third-party company meets the information security requirements, so the customer asks us to try to spend a week to see if it can crack the App to get the data inside. In the week, we decompiled and analyzed the program logic, finally cracked the App, and submitted a security risk report. A few months later, the third-party company provided an upgraded App with a new encryption method. We verified it again and gave the final report. The reason I like this project more is that it is a more challenging project than other normal information management systems.
- What tech stack have you used before?
We use Java, Spring, and MyBatis for the backend, Jquery, and Bootstrap for the frontend. The database is Oracle.
- What were your roles and responsibilities?
Mainly my role is developer, In my last year in this company, I sometimes participate in part of the business requirement analysis work.
