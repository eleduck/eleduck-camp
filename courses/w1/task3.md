I used to be a front-end engineer in an artificial intelligence company named Yitu tech. It focused on face identification technology, which is very helpful to catch the criminal.
The projects we did are served for the police, help them use the face identification system more easily. Usually, there is a map on the first screen of our project, including alert information, camera location, and it also has a face database management module, and alert configuration module.

Xuhui intelligent face control system is my favorite project because it was completed all by myself in front-end development.

I used React, Redux, Redux-saga, and other tech stacks from React Family in my last job, Vue is used more now.

My role is a junior front-end developer, responsible for daily development tasks, make the project online as planned.
