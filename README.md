## Way of Work

The training camp has four weeks as a period. And there will be one squeeze day at the end of each week, to align with all students, in case someone was delayed with tasks by any reasons. The training camp will mix with tasks, online lectures and coding practice, etc. The **courses** folder in this repo contains courses schedule and tasks for each week, it is recommended to work on one task per day, but feel free to adjust on your own pace. 

To work on tasks, please create a **separate branch** in this repository, and try to answer at least **three** questions for each task in the same file and send a Pull Request, the coach will help to review the solutions. **Important**: Please DO **NOT** push to **main** branch, work ONLY on your own branch, your PR will NOT be merged.
